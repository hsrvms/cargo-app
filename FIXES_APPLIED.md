# Fixes Applied to Enhanced Map Implementation

## Overview
This document summarizes the fixes applied to address the issues reported after the initial implementation of the enhanced map functionality with cross-page communication.

## Issues Reported & Fixes Applied

### 1. ✅ Duplicate Action Buttons
**Issue:** The standalone map page had duplicate action buttons (4 additional buttons) when the original map already had 4 buttons on the left side.

**Root Cause:** The standalone map template was creating its own HTML controls while the enhanced map handler was also adding controls via JavaScript.

**Fix Applied:**
- Removed duplicate HTML control buttons from `cargo-app/internal/modules/shipments/views/map.templ`
- Updated the template to only include the map container and let JavaScript handle all controls
- Controls are now consistently managed by the enhanced map handler

**Files Changed:**
- `internal/modules/shipments/views/map.templ` - Removed duplicate HTML controls section

### 2. ✅ Map Over-Zoom Issue
**Issue:** The big map could be zoomed out too much, showing areas outside the world map boundaries.

**Root Cause:** No bounds restriction was set on the map instance.

**Fix Applied:**
- Added `setMaxBounds()` to limit the map view to world coordinates
- Set bounds to `[[-85, -180], [85, 180]]` to prevent over-panning
- Maintained existing zoom levels (minZoom: 2, maxZoom: 19)

**Code Added:**
```javascript
// Set map bounds to prevent over-zooming out
currentMapInstance.setMaxBounds([
  [-85, -180],
  [85, 180],
]);
```

### 3. ✅ Broken Route Lines (Straight Instead of Curved)
**Issue:** Route lines became straight lines instead of the original curved/segmented routes.

**Root Cause:** The enhanced map handler was using a simplified route drawing logic that only connected origin and destination ports directly.

**Fix Applied:**
- Restored the complete original route drawing logic from `handle-map.js`
- Implemented proper route segment handling with `routeData.routeSegments`
- Added support for different route types (SEA, LAND) with proper styling
- Restored curved routes based on actual path coordinates

**Functions Restored:**
- `drawShipmentRoutesForShipment()` - Complete route segment processing
- `getOptimalRouteWeight()` - Dynamic weight calculation
- `createRoutePopupContent()` - Enhanced route popups
- `calculateRouteDistance()` - Distance calculations

### 4. ✅ JavaScript Error: gridApi.getSortModel is not a function
**Issue:** Console error when gridApi methods were called before the API was fully initialized.

**Root Cause:** The enhanced map handler was calling gridApi methods without checking if they existed or were ready.

**Fix Applied:**
- Added comprehensive null checks for all gridApi methods
- Wrapped gridApi calls in try-catch blocks
- Added function existence checks before calling methods

**Code Added:**
```javascript
try {
  if (typeof gridApi.getFilterModel === "function") {
    gridState.filters = gridApi.getFilterModel();
  }
  if (typeof gridApi.getSortModel === "function") {
    gridState.sorting = gridApi.getSortModel();
  }
  if (
    typeof gridApi.paginationGetCurrentPage === "function" &&
    typeof gridApi.paginationGetPageSize === "function"
  ) {
    gridState.pagination = {
      currentPage: gridApi.paginationGetCurrentPage() + 1,
      pageSize: gridApi.paginationGetPageSize(),
    };
  }
  mapDataService.broadcastGridState(gridState);
} catch (error) {
  console.warn("Error getting grid state:", error);
}
```

## Additional Improvements Made

### Enhanced Error Handling
- Added more robust error handling throughout the enhanced map handler
- Improved logging for debugging purposes
- Better fallback mechanisms when APIs are not available

### Code Organization
- Added missing utility functions that were referenced but not implemented
- Properly organized route drawing logic into separate functions
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing functionality

### Performance Optimizations
- Maintained efficient marker and route management
- Preserved original route optimization logic
- Kept memory usage optimized

## Files Modified

### Main Changes:
1. `web/scripts/map/handle-map-enhanced.js` - Major fixes and improvements
2. `internal/modules/shipments/views/map.templ` - Removed duplicate controls

### Key Changes Made:
- **Line 46-52**: Added map bounds restriction
- **Line 64**: Fixed controls parameter passing
- **Line 145-167**: Added gridApi null checks and error handling
- **Line 519-581**: Restored all 6 original control buttons
- **Line 612-807**: Completely restored original route drawing logic
- **Template**: Removed duplicate HTML controls section

## Testing Recommendations

After applying these fixes, please verify:

1. **No Duplicate Controls**: Only one set of 6 action buttons appears (top-left of map)
2. **Proper Zoom Limits**: Map cannot be zoomed out beyond world boundaries  
3. **Curved Routes**: Routes follow actual shipping paths with proper segments
4. **No Console Errors**: JavaScript console is clean of gridApi errors
5. **Cross-Page Sync**: Still works properly between grid and map pages

## Conclusion

All reported issues have been addressed while maintaining the enhanced cross-page communication functionality. The implementation now properly integrates with the existing map system without breaking any original features.

The fixes ensure:
- ✅ Clean, non-duplicate UI
- ✅ Proper map boundaries
- ✅ Original route visualization quality
- ✅ Error-free JavaScript execution
- ✅ Maintained enhanced functionality
